# DrumMusicXMLGenerator
A system to produce a subset of drum music notation.

I made this as part of a senior design group project in 2016-2017.
Project website: http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Snare_Drum_Notator

Removed from the rest of the project by hand, so it might not be in working order.

Targets the soundslice renderer found at https://www.soundslice.com/musicxml-viewer/
